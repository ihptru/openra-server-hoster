* Check if there is a new OpenRA release or playtest;
* Automatically Fetch&Compile if it founds one;
* Host a server, one per mod (with proper version tag) in a separate screen session

To Start:
./check_updates_and_host.py

Note:
  start and terminate several times (3), so it generates all required local data
  to make it host servers for current versions, edit `version.txt` with lower values
